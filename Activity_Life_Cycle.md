#2 The Diffrence and Similarities Between The Life Cycle of an Activity and Fragment
Activities are where all the action happens, because they are the screens that allow the user to interact with your app.
Activities are the foundations upon which screens and all UI elements for the app built. They encompass multiple components the user can interact with.
While on the other hand a fragment is an Android component that holds part of the behavior and/or UI of an activity. As the name would suggest, fragments are not independent entities, but are tied to a single activity. In many ways, they have functionality similar to activities.
